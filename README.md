# Duck Duck Goose: Analysis of France's HPAI Vaccination Campaign

This repository contains the analysis and visualization code to examine how effective France's first nationwide HPAI H5N1 vaccination campaign was in quelling infection rates among domestic poultry populations. The project employs interrupted time series analysis to evaluate outbreak patterns before, during, and after vaccination implementation. The results have been compiled in both a report and a webpage.
